            <p>
                We provide fragrance samples and decants using the original and
                authentic perfumes & colognes, transferred by hand into 
                individually labeled glass bottles in sizes & types of your 
                choice with a small removable shipping seal (on certain sizes) 
                to maintain product integrity during transit. All orders are 
                shipped within decorative gift boxes.

                <br>
                A ‘Sample’ or a ‘Decant’ is really the same thing, we refer to 
                our products as ‘Decants’ as this is a commonly accepted term 
                that carries with it a respected and time-honored heritage; 
                others may opt for the words travel sized, purse sized, and/or 
                sample sized.
                <br>
                <br>
                All of our fragrances are decanted from the original bottles 
                into various size glass spray or roller ball bottles inside our 
                perfume lab using the highest quality measuring & decanting 
                techniques and equipment. Everything is performed in clean and 
                sterile conditions that would be expected with the precision 
                and pride that comes with being a fragrance enthusiast and a 
                biomedical engineering technologist.
